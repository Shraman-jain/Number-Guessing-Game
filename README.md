# Number-Guessing-Game
The game will pick a number randomly from 1 to 100 and the player needs to guess the exact number guessed by calculating the hint. The player will get 7 chances to guess the number and for every wrong guess game will tell you if the number is more or less or you can take a random hint to guess the number like (2+2=?, 3*3=?) to guess the number.
